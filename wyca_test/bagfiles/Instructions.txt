THE GOAL is that humans around the robot should be able to understand if and how fast the robot moves just by listening to it.

To this end, complete the following steps using the test bag file:

- write a ROS node in python or C++ which subscribes to /cmd_vel and generate a sound which varies with the speed of the robot. You are free to chose which sound sample to use and what changes with the speed: pitch, frequency, other sample, etc...

- assume that the robot is differentially driven and moves in a 2d plane

- write commented "clean code"

- if you need additional dependencies (ROS or system), provides an installation script ( .sh for instance)

- upload the source code of your ROS package on a github public repository ( https://github.com/ ) and send us the link no later than Friday the 5th of January 

PLEASE NOTE: We will test the node on ROS Kinetic under Ubuntu 16.04 using the same test.bag you received. Your package should be able to compile (with no Errors :-) ) on our test machine.

BONUS TASK: generate a map in the *.pgm or *.png format using the same bag
